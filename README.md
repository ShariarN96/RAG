# AI-Driven Research Discovery via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project implements an AI-powered research chatbot designed to accelerate literature reviews and provide domain-specific research insights from full-text Wiley articles. It combines a scalable ETL pipeline, advanced text processing/embeddings, and LLM-powered conversational retrieval to streamline the discovery of scientific knowledge.
